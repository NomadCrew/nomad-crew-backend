# Nomad Crew - Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend API for the **Nomad Crew** platform — a mobile-first app that simplifies group travel planning through real-time coordination, expense tracking, and collaborative features.

The backend is a **monolithic Go application** built using the **Gin** web framework. It exposes RESTful endpoints and WebSocket interfaces to power features like:

- User authentication and profile management
- Comprehensive trip planning and management
- Trip-specific real-time chat and event streaming via WebSockets
- Real-time location tracking for users and trip members
- Trip-specific to-do list management
- Member invitation system for trips (acceptance flow needs verification)
- User notification system (real-time delivery strategy under review for optimization)
- Role-based permissions (via middleware and service layer checks)

It integrates with **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage, **Redis** for caching, and **Supabase** for authentication services.

## MVP Release Focus

We're currently working toward an MVP release with these priorities:

### Core MVP Functionality

- User authentication (via Supabase) and account/profile management
- Trip Creation, Management: Create, list, search, view, update, delete trips; manage trip status.
- Trip Member Management: Add members to trips, update their roles, remove them.
- Trip Invitation System: Invite users to trips. (Note: Invitation acceptance and lifecycle management flows require full verification and potential implementation).
- Trip-Specific Real-Time Chat: WebSocket-based chat within trips for coordination, including listing messages and managing read status. (Message sending/reactions via HTTP are in progress). Chat is automatically created with each trip.
- Location Sharing: Real-time location updates for users (general) and specifically for trip members.
- Trip-Specific To-Do Lists: Manage tasks and checklists within the context of a trip.
- Basic Notification System: Users can receive and manage notifications. (Note: The real-time delivery mechanism for general notifications is under review for cost-effectiveness and efficiency, distinct from active trip chat).

### Current Focus

- Stabilizing critical services (chat, websockets, auth)
- Ensuring core API endpoints work reliably
- Fixing compilation errors and critical bugs
- Verifying end-to-end flows for key user journeys

### Post-MVP Improvements

- Enhanced documentation with complete Swagger annotations
- Expanded test coverage
- Non-critical bug fixes and optimizations
- Additional features as prioritized

> Our goal is to deliver a functional, stable product as quickly as possible to gather user feedback.

## Architecture

The codebase follows a layered, modular architecture to promote testability and maintainability:

1. **`main.go`** – Application entry point: sets up dependencies and starts the server.
2. **`router/`** – Defines API routes and middleware.
3. **`handlers/`** – Gin HTTP handlers: parse input, validate, call services.
4. **`models/*/service/`** – Business logic layer for each domain (e.g., trips, locations, crews). All permission checks happen here.
5. **`db/`** – Data access layer using `pgx` to query PostgreSQL.
6. **`middleware/`** – Custom middleware for JWT validation, CORS, error handling, rate limiting.
7. **`internal/`** – Internal systems including:
   - `ws/`: WebSocket manager for live communication
   - `events/`: Internal event struct definitions and dispatching

> ⚠️ Some legacy logic still resides in `services/`. All new features should follow the `models/*/service/` convention.

Refer to `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for a detailed breakdown of the directory structure.

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger/OpenAPI. You can access the interactive documentation at `/swagger/index.html` when the server is running.

## Generating Documentation

To generate or update the API documentation:

1. Ensure your handler functions are properly annotated with Swagger comments
2. Run the following command:

```bash
swag init -g main.go -o ./static/docs/api
```

## Documentation Tool

We provide a documentation helper tool to assist with adding Swagger annotations:

```bash
cd scripts/doc_generator
go run main.go
```

This will scan all handlers and provide templates for undocumented endpoints.

For more information, see the [API Documentation Guide](docs/api-documentation-guide.md).

---

## Authentication Flow

User authentication is handled by Supabase. After logging in, Supabase issues a JWT that the backend validates via JWKS. Auth middleware extracts and verifies the token on protected endpoints. Role and permission checks are enforced in service layers.

---

## Real-Time Features

The application leverages WebSockets and an internal event system for real-time updates:

- **Trip-Specific Chat & Events:** A dedicated WebSocket connection (`/v1/trips/:id/chat/ws/events`) is established when a user engages with a specific trip's chat. This connection handles real-time message exchange and other trip-specific events directly related to that chat session.
- **Live Location Updates:** User and trip member location data is updated in real-time.
- **General Notifications & Updates:** The system supports broadcasting other events and general notifications (e.g., new trip invitations, general alerts). The current real-time delivery strategy for these general updates (potentially via the `/v1/ws` endpoint or other mechanisms) is being evaluated to ensure cost-effectiveness and optimal performance, differentiating from the active trip-chat WebSockets.

Internal events are defined in `internal/events/` and may be dispatched through services like `services/event_service.go` (potentially using Redis Pub/Sub for inter-service communication if applicable).

## Deployment

The app is deployed on AWS EC2 with Coolify for container orchestration.

### Production

- **API URL**: https://api.nomadcrew.uk
- **Infrastructure**: AWS EC2 m8g.large (4 vCPU, 16 GB Graviton4)
- **SSL**: Let's Encrypt (auto-renewed via Coolify/Traefik)
- **Orchestration**: Coolify (self-hosted PaaS)

### CI/CD Workflows

- `deploy-coolify.yml` – runs tests, security scan, triggers Coolify webhook deploy on merge to main
- `main.yml` – runs tests and security checks
- `golang-cilint.yml` – linting workflow

### How Deployment Works

1. Push to `main` triggers GitHub Actions
2. Tests and security scans run
3. On success, webhook notifies Coolify
4. Coolify pulls latest code, builds Docker image, deploys
5. Traefik handles SSL termination and routing

### Notes

- HTTPS enforced in production (HTTP redirects to HTTPS)
- Environment variables configured in Coolify dashboard
- Coolify dashboard: accessible on port 8000 (restricted access)
