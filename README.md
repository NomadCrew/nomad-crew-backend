# Nomad Crew - Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend API for the **Nomad Crew** platform ‚Äî a mobile-first app that simplifies group travel planning through real-time coordination, expense tracking, and collaborative features.

The backend is a **monolithic Go application** built using the **Gin** web framework. It exposes RESTful endpoints and WebSocket interfaces to power features like:

- User authentication and profile management
- Comprehensive trip planning and management
- Trip-specific real-time chat and event streaming via WebSockets
- Real-time location tracking for users and trip members
- Trip-specific to-do list management
- Member invitation system for trips (acceptance flow needs verification)
- User notification system (real-time delivery strategy under review for optimization)
- Role-based permissions (via middleware and service layer checks)

It integrates with **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage, **Redis** for caching, and **Supabase** for authentication services.

## MVP Release Focus

We're currently working toward an MVP release with these priorities:

### Core MVP Functionality

- User authentication (via Supabase) and account/profile management
- Trip Creation, Management: Create, list, search, view, update, delete trips; manage trip status.
- Trip Member Management: Add members to trips, update their roles, remove them.
- Trip Invitation System: Invite users to trips. (Note: Invitation acceptance and lifecycle management flows require full verification and potential implementation).
- Trip-Specific Real-Time Chat: WebSocket-based chat within trips for coordination, including listing messages and managing read status. (Message sending/reactions via HTTP are in progress). Chat is automatically created with each trip.
- Location Sharing: Real-time location updates for users (general) and specifically for trip members.
- Trip-Specific To-Do Lists: Manage tasks and checklists within the context of a trip.
- Basic Notification System: Users can receive and manage notifications. (Note: The real-time delivery mechanism for general notifications is under review for cost-effectiveness and efficiency, distinct from active trip chat).

### Current Focus

- Stabilizing critical services (chat, websockets, auth)
- Ensuring core API endpoints work reliably
- Fixing compilation errors and critical bugs
- Verifying end-to-end flows for key user journeys

### Post-MVP Improvements

- Enhanced documentation with complete Swagger annotations
- Expanded test coverage
- Non-critical bug fixes and optimizations
- Additional features as prioritized

> Our goal is to deliver a functional, stable product as quickly as possible to gather user feedback.

## Architecture

The codebase follows a layered, modular architecture to promote testability and maintainability:

1. **`main.go`** ‚Äì Application entry point: sets up dependencies and starts the server.
2. **`router/`** ‚Äì Defines API routes and middleware.
3. **`handlers/`** ‚Äì Gin HTTP handlers: parse input, validate, call services.
4. **`models/*/service/`** ‚Äì Business logic layer for each domain (e.g., trips, locations, crews). All permission checks happen here.
5. **`db/`** ‚Äì Data access layer using `pgx` to query PostgreSQL.
6. **`middleware/`** ‚Äì Custom middleware for JWT validation, CORS, error handling, rate limiting.
7. **`internal/`** ‚Äì Internal systems including:
   - `ws/`: WebSocket manager for live communication
   - `events/`: Internal event struct definitions and dispatching

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some legacy logic still resides in `services/`. All new features should follow the `models/*/service/` convention.

Refer to `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for a detailed breakdown of the directory structure.

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger/OpenAPI. You can access the interactive documentation at `/swagger/index.html` when the server is running.

## Generating Documentation

To generate or update the API documentation:

1. Ensure your handler functions are properly annotated with Swagger comments
2. Run the following command:

```bash
swag init -g main.go -o ./static/docs/api
```

## Documentation Tool

We provide a documentation helper tool to assist with adding Swagger annotations:

```bash
cd scripts/doc_generator
go run main.go
```

This will scan all handlers and provide templates for undocumented endpoints.

For more information, see the [API Documentation Guide](docs/api-documentation-guide.md).

---

## Authentication Flow

User authentication is handled by Supabase. After logging in, Supabase issues a JWT that the backend validates via JWKS. Auth middleware extracts and verifies the token on protected endpoints. Role and permission checks are enforced in service layers.

---

## Real-Time Features

The application leverages WebSockets and an internal event system for real-time updates:

- **Trip-Specific Chat & Events:** A dedicated WebSocket connection (`/v1/trips/:id/chat/ws/events`) is established when a user engages with a specific trip's chat. This connection handles real-time message exchange and other trip-specific events directly related to that chat session.
- **Live Location Updates:** User and trip member location data is updated in real-time.
- **General Notifications & Updates:** The system supports broadcasting other events and general notifications (e.g., new trip invitations, general alerts). The current real-time delivery strategy for these general updates (potentially via the `/v1/ws` endpoint or other mechanisms) is being evaluated to ensure cost-effectiveness and optimal performance, differentiating from the active trip-chat WebSockets.

Internal events are defined in `internal/events/` and may be dispatched through services like `services/event_service.go` (potentially using Redis Pub/Sub for inter-service communication if applicable).
