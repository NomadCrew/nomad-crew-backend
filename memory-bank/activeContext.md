# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are now transitioning to updating dependent services to use the new event system implementation. This involves migrating each service from the old event system to the new one while maintaining functionality.

### Recent Changes
1. Completed test implementation for event system:
   - Consolidated test helpers in `test_helpers.go`
   - Fixed Event struct usage and method signatures
   - Removed duplicate declarations
   - Added comprehensive test coverage

2. Test Coverage Status:
   - Event validation ✓
   - Error scenarios ✓
   - Concurrent operations ✓
   - Redis connection handling ✓
   - Handler lifecycle ✓
   - Subscription management ✓

### Active Decisions
1. Migration Strategy:
   - Migrate one service at a time
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition
   - Add metrics for monitoring migration success
   - Roll back capability if issues arise

2. Service Migration Order:
   1. Chat Service (highest event volume)
   2. Trip Service (core functionality)
   3. Location Service (real-time updates)
   4. Weather Service (periodic updates)

### Next Steps
1. Update Chat Service:
   - Migrate event publishing
   - Update WebSocket event handling
   - Test message delivery and reactions
   - Verify real-time updates

2. Update Trip Service:
   - Migrate trip status events
   - Update invitation handling
   - Test member notifications
   - Verify trip updates

3. Update Location Service:
   - Migrate location update events
   - Test real-time tracking
   - Verify offline sync

4. Update Weather Service:
   - Migrate weather update events
   - Test periodic updates
   - Verify alert system

### Current Issues
1. Migration Considerations:
   - Ensure no event loss during transition
   - Handle in-flight events properly
   - Maintain event order guarantees
   - Monitor performance impact

### Technical Considerations
1. Service Updates:
   - Update service interfaces
   - Migrate event handlers
   - Update event type constants
   - Add new metrics

2. Testing Strategy:
   - Integration tests for each service
   - End-to-end event flow testing
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Migration verification

### Completed
1. Event System Implementation:
   - Core components implemented ✓
   - Test coverage complete ✓
   - Documentation updated ✓
   - Performance verified ✓

2. Test Improvements:
   - Consolidated test helpers ✓
   - Fixed struct usage ✓
   - Removed duplications ✓
   - Added error scenarios ✓

### Dependencies
- go-redis/redis/v9 (✓)
- testify for testing (✓)
- prometheus for metrics (✓)

### Notes
- Monitor Redis connection pool during migration
- Watch for increased latency
- Track failed event deliveries
- Document service-specific event patterns
