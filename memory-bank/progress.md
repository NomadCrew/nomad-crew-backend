- **Invitation System Core Logic:**
    - `CommandContext` now includes `UserStore` for enhanced permission checks.
    - `UpdateInvitationStatusCommand` correctly uses `UserStore` to verify invitee by email if `InviteeID` is missing.
    - `DeclineInvitationHandler` fully implemented using `UpdateInvitationStatusCommand`.
- **Compilation and Test Coverage Planning:**
    - Analyzed codebase compile errors
    - Created plan for fixing compilation issues and adding tests
    - Selected location feature as first focus area
- **Linter/Compilation Error Fixes (Priority 0 - In Progress):**
    - `tests/integration/chat_integration_test.go`: Resolved import paths and method signature mismatches for `chatservice`.
    - `internal/store/postgres/location_test.go`: Commented out tests related to removed offline location functionality.
    - `internal/handlers/location_test.go`: Commented out mock methods and routes for removed offline location functionality.
    - `models/user/service/user_service.go`: Fixed type mismatches for user IDs and return types; corrected `UpdateUser` request handling.
    - `models/todo_test.go`: Updated `NewTodoModel` calls with `MockEventPublisher`.
    - `models/trip/trip_model.go`: Added `GetCommandContext()` and updated `NewTripModel` signature and internal call to `NewTripModelCoordinator` (cascading error to `main.go`).
- **Critical Compilation Issues Fixed:**
    - Added missing `GetCommandContext()` method to `MockTripModel` in `middleware/rbac_test.go`
    - Added missing `GetUserByID()` method to `ChatStore` in `internal/store/postgres/chat_store.go`
    - Fixed redundant newline in `fmt.Println()` statement in `scripts/doc_generator/main.go`
    - Updated user field references in `internal/store/postgres/chat_store_test.go`
    - Created necessary mock implementations:
        - `ChatStore` mock in `internal/store/mocks/ChatStore.go`
        - `TripStore` mock in `internal/store/mocks/TripStore.go`
- **Fixed Type Mismatch Issues in Unit Tests:**
    - Fixed `GetTripMembers` return type in `MockTripMemberService` to match the interface
    - Fixed ChatService interface reference in `internal/handlers/chat_handler_test.go`
    - Added platform-specific code to skip Docker testcontainer tests on Windows
    - Fixed `MockWeatherService` implementation in models/tests/trip_test.go
    - Fixed incorrect error type references in trip_service_test.go
    - Successfully fixed compilation issues in key packages:
        - middleware
        - internal/store/postgres
        - models/trip/service
        - models/trip/command
        - models/tests
- **Fixed Location Feature Tests:**
    - Resolved nil pointer dereference in `TestGetTripMemberLocations` by fixing method call mismatches in `models/location/service/location_service_test.go`
    - Updated test signatures in location service tests to match interface implementations
    - Fixed mock return types to use regular slice instead of pointer slice where needed
    - Added platform-specific code to skip Docker-dependent tests on Windows in `internal/store/postgres/location_test.go`
    - Updated `handlers/location_handler.go` to use interface type instead of concrete implementation for better testing
    - Fixed handler tests to use proper mocks matching the service interface
    - Implemented comprehensive interface checks using `var _ InterfaceType = (*ImplementationType)(nil)` pattern
    - Ensured all location-related tests pass on Windows platform
- **Fixed WebSocket Handler Tests:**
    - Implemented comprehensive mock of TripStore interface for testing WebSocket functionality
    - Created MockWSHandler to provide test-specific versions of handler methods
    - Adopted alternative testing approach to address type compatibility issues
    - Fixed issues with event type constants in WebSocket tests
    - Removed outdated ChatStore references from WSHandler
    - Simplified test setup by focusing on specific handler behaviors
    - Successfully ran and passed all WebSocket handler tests
    - Added better error handling for rate limiting and event publishing
- **Fixed Core Tests in Handlers and Models Packages:**
    - Fixed `chat_handler_test.go` by updating the constructor call to match the actual implementation
    - Fixed `trip_model_coordinator_test.go` by correcting the `GetTripMembers` return type in mocks
    - Fixed `trip_test.go` by properly handling status transitions and adding correct mock expectations
    - Fixed `router_test.go` by implementing a custom test router with non-registering Prometheus metrics
    - Fixed `trip_service_test.go` by correcting method implementations in MockWeatherService
    - Successfully ran all unit tests except those requiring Docker containers or integration environments
    - **Successfully built the entire project with `go build` without any compilation errors**
- All integration tests in `TestChatIntegrationSuite` are passing their core assertions.
- `TestDeclineInvitation_Success_InviteeIDKnown` in `invitation_integration_test.go` is passing.
- Database schema issues related to nullable `LastSeenAt` fields (`types.User`, `models.User`) have been resolved.
- Authentication context propagation for `UserID` in invitation decline flow is working.
- Foreign key constraint errors in chat setup (user and trip creation) are resolved.
- Nil pointer dereferences in invitation test setup are fixed.
- JWT secret key configuration for HS256 validation in invitation tests is corrected.

## 🚧 What's In Progress
- Investigating and planning to resolve warnings: `Failed to get user ID from context for event publishing` in `TestChatIntegrationSuite`.

## 📝 What's Left / To Do
- **High Priority**:
    - Refactor `TestChatIntegrationSuite` to use an HTTP test server and include JWT authentication in test requests to ensure `UserID` is available in the context for event publishing (as detailed in `activeContext.md -> Next Steps`).
- **Medium Priority**:
    - Investigate and address Redis PubSub EOF errors during test container shutdowns.
    - Address `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET not set` warning in `TestNewJWTValidator` (ensure test config is robust).
- **Low Priority / Future**:
    - Implement skipped tests:
        - `TestMigrations` (db/dbutils) - Requires `DB_TEST=true`.
        - `TestChatService/TestCreateGroup_Success` (internal/service) - Not implemented.
        - `TestTripServiceTestSuite/TestExample_Placeholder` (models/trip/service) - Placeholder.
        - `TestChatWebSocketHandling` (tests) - Marked for manual run.
        - `TestTripIntegration` (tests/integration) - Not implemented.

## 🪵 Design Decisions Log
- `types.User.LastSeenAt` and `models.User.LastSeenAt` changed to `*time.Time` to handle nullable database values.
- `invitation_handler.go` updated to use `string(middleware.UserIDKey)` for retrieving UserID from context.
- Router configuration in `router/router.go` for invitation accept/decline routes moved to an authenticated group.
- `chat_integration_test.go` setup modified to ensure correct `testUserID` propagation and added a small delay for DB commit visibility.
- `types/invitation.go` changed `TripInvitation.Token` to `sql.NullString` and updated related test helpers.
- `models/trip/command/invite_member.go` updated to assign token to `sql.NullString` field correctly.

## 📋 What's Left for MVP Release
