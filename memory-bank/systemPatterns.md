# NomadCrew Backend - System Patterns

## Overview
This document outlines the major system patterns, architectural decisions, and design philosophies employed in the NomadCrew backend.

## Key Patterns & Decisions
*(To be populated based on ongoing codebase analysis and feature identification)*

- **Layered Architecture:** (e.g., handlers -> services -> models -> db)
- **RESTful API Design:** (Principles followed, versioning strategy)
- **Real-time Communication:** (WebSocket usage, event-driven patterns for chat/notifications)
- **Authentication & Authorization:** (JWT, Supabase integration, middleware patterns)
- **Database Interaction:** (ORM/Driver usage, migration strategy, transaction management)
- **Error Handling Strategy:** (Custom errors, centralized handling)
- **Concurrency Patterns:** (Goroutines, channels, synchronization)
- **Modularity & Decoupling:** (How services and components are kept independent)
- **External Service Integration:** (Patterns for interacting with 3rd party APIs like Supabase, Pexels, etc.)
