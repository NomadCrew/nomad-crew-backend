# Product Context

## Problem Solved

NomadCrew aims to connect digital nomads and travelers, making it easier to form temporary communities ('crews') and plan collaborative trips. This backend powers the platform that facilitates these connections and planning activities.

## How It Works (User Perspective)

1.  **Sign Up/Login:** Users create accounts or log in.
2.  **Profile:** Users manage their profiles (skills, interests, travel style).
3.  **Discover:** Users find potential crewmates or existing crews.
4.  **Create/Join Crews:** Users can start new crews or request to join existing ones.
5.  **Plan Trips:** Crews collaborate on trip details (destinations, itinerary, budget).
6.  **Communicate:** Real-time features allow crew members to communicate and stay updated.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Seamless:** Easy onboarding and intuitive navigation.
*   **Collaborative:** Tools that genuinely facilitate group planning.
*   **Reliable:** Consistent performance and real-time updates.
*   **Secure:** User data and communications must be protected.
