# NomadCrew Backend - Tasks

##  Project Goals
- Build a robust backend API for the NomadCrew trip planning application
- Support real-time features for trip coordination
- Provide secure authentication and data storage
- Ensure scalable and maintainable codebase
- **Release MVP as soon as possible**
- **Ensure all code compiles and has >90% test coverage**

##  What Works
- Memory Bank initialization
- Project structure setup
- Basic documentation structure
- Core trip management functionality
- User authentication
- WebSocket connections (improved reliability)
- Basic chat functionality
- Chat service implementation (fixed)
- Location tracking
- Event publishing for real-time updates
- Fixed User type conversion issues for Preferences field
- Fixed timestamp and type handling in trip commands
- Enhanced error logging for production monitoring
- Request tracking with unique request IDs
- Authentication flow verification tools
- API endpoint stability testing tools

##  What's Left for MVP Release
- **Fix compilation issues across the codebase**
- **Ensure >90% test coverage for all features**
- **Fix type and interface inconsistencies**
- Verify deployed environment configuration
- Run verification tools against staging environment
- Deploy MVP release to production

## Current Feature Focus: Location Management
- **Verify and fix compilation issues in the location feature**
- **Run existing location service tests**
- **Add integration tests for location feature**
- **Ensure error handling is robust**
- **Validate event publishing for real-time updates**

##  Post-Release Improvements
- Complete Swagger annotations
- Improve documentation coverage
- Refactor and consolidate service implementations
- Enhance test coverage
- Address non-critical linter errors
- Optimize database queries

##  Current Blockers
- **Compilation issues in multiple packages**
- **Insufficient test coverage**
- **Type and interface inconsistencies**

##  Progress Update

- Added proper error handling in chat service methods
- Fixed event type naming in publishChatEvent method
- Fixed type conversion issue with User.Preferences field to match how it's used in UserStore
- Improved timestamp handling in trip commands by using UTC consistently
- Fixed duplicate event publishing in trip commands
- Ensured proper JSON serialization of timestamps in event payloads
- Enhanced WebSocket connection handling with better error recovery
- Improved WebSocket connection validation and reconnection strategy
- Added more robust connection lifecycle management for WebSockets
- Implemented enhanced error logging system for production monitoring
- Added request ID middleware for better request tracking
- Developed authentication flow verification tool in scripts/auth_verification
- Created API endpoint stability test tool in scripts/api_verification
- Updated error handler middleware to use the enhanced logging system
- **Created plan for fixing compilation issues and ensuring test coverage**
- **Selected location management as first feature focus**
