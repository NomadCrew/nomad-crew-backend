# NomadCrew Backend - Tasks

##  Project Goals
- Build a robust backend API for the NomadCrew trip planning application
- Support real-time features for trip coordination
- Provide secure authentication and data storage
- Ensure scalable and maintainable codebase
- **Release MVP as soon as possible**
- **Ensure all code compiles and has >90% test coverage**

##  What Works
- Memory Bank initialization
- Project structure setup
- Basic documentation structure
- Core trip management functionality
- User authentication
- WebSocket connections (improved reliability)
- Basic chat functionality
- Chat service implementation (fixed)
- Location tracking
- Event publishing for real-time updates
- Fixed User type conversion issues for Preferences field
- Fixed timestamp and type handling in trip commands
- Enhanced error logging for production monitoring
- Request tracking with unique request IDs
- Authentication flow verification tools
- API endpoint stability testing tools
- **Fixed compilation issues across the codebase**
- **Successfully built entire project with `go build`**
- **Fixed critical test failures in core packages**

##  What's Left for MVP Release
- **Finalize integration test fixes**
  - Create platform-specific skipping for Docker-dependent tests
  - Update TestMain functions to handle environment detection consistently
  - Document how to run integration tests in CI environment
- **Review main.go service initializations**
  - Verify service interfaces are used correctly
  - Ensure router setup properly references all handlers
- **Improve test coverage to >90%**
  - Add more unit tests for edge cases
  - Create additional integration tests for key features
  - Ensure error handling is thoroughly tested
- **Verify trip invitation feature works end-to-end**
  - Test all invitation scenarios (create, accept, decline)
  - Verify email-based verification works correctly
- **Final pre-release validation**
  - Test against staging environment
  - Verify authentication flow
  - Confirm deployment process

## Current Feature Focus: Integration Tests
- **Create consistent environment detection for test skipping**
- **Update TestMain functions for proper test setup/teardown**
- **Document integration test requirements**
- **Add platform-specific code for Windows compatibility**
- **Consider creating Docker-free test alternatives where possible**

##  Post-Release Improvements
- Complete Swagger annotations
- Improve documentation coverage
- Refactor and consolidate service implementations
- Enhance test coverage
- Address non-critical linter errors
- Optimize database queries

##  Current Blockers
- **Docker-dependent integration tests failing on Windows**
- **TestMain conflicts in some test packages**
- **Lack of environment detection in some test packages**

- Implemented enhanced error logging system for production monitoring
- Added request ID middleware for better request tracking
- Developed authentication flow verification tool in scripts/auth_verification
- Created API endpoint stability test tool in scripts/api_verification
- Updated error handler middleware to use the enhanced logging system
- **Fixed critical compilation issues across the entire codebase:**
  - Added missing method implementations to match interfaces
  - Corrected return types in mock implementations
  - Fixed interface references and type mismatches
  - Updated constructor calls to use correct parameters
  - Created comprehensive mocks for testing
- **Fixed test failures in core components:**

  - Fixed trip_model_coordinator_test.go
  - Corrected trip_test.go status transition tests
  - Created custom test router in events package
  - Successfully ran all unit tests
  - Built project without compilation errors
